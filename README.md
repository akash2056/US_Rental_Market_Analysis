# 🏠 US Rental Market Analysis: Trends, Pricing, and Insights

This project analyzes **99,105 US apartment listings** to uncover rental market trends, pricing dynamics, and the impact of location/amenities. Leveraging Tableau for visualization, it provides actionable insights for renters, investors, and policymakers.

## 📊 **Project Highlights**
- **Dataset**: Publicly available data from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/555/apartment+for+rent+classified) (2018-2019).
- **Key Features**: 
  - Price trends by state, city, and property type.
  - Interactive dashboards for dynamic filtering (e.g., bedrooms, location).
  - Geospatial analysis of rental density and price per square foot.
  - Seasonal pricing fluctuations and luxury vs. budget segmentation.

## 🛠️ **Data Processing**
- **Cleaning**: Handled missing values via median imputation, text standardization, and outlier removal.
- **Tools**: Python (Pandas, NumPy) for preprocessing; Tableau for visualization.
- **Techniques**: Feature engineering (price/sqft), multivariate analysis, and 3D density plots.

## 🔍 **Key Insights**
- **Top Markets**: Hawaii (HI), New York (NY), and California (CA) have the highest average rents due to urban demand.
- **Affordability**: Rural areas (e.g., Wyoming, Kansas) offer lower prices vs. metropolitan hubs.
- **Size vs. Price**: Larger units (2+ bedrooms/bathrooms) command premium prices, but trends vary by region.
- **Seasonality**: Prices peak in winter (e.g., Texas: $1,152 in Feb 2019) and dip in off-seasons.
